Example [Backstage](https://backstage.io) app

## Development environment

The recommended development environment is a [GitHub Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces),
as this will configure everything for you in minimal time.  All you need to do is 
[create a Codespace from this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository#creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository). When you create your
Codespace, it's recommended to give it no less than 8GB of RAM, to avoid out of memory problems.

## Run the app

The Backstage app files in this repo were generated by running `npx @backstage/create-app@latest`, as per
[the instructions in the Backstage getting started guide](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/#create-your-backstage-app).

To run the app (as per [the Backstage getting started guide](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/#run-the-backstage-app):

- `cd my-backstage-app && yarn dev`

- go to http://localhost:3000
